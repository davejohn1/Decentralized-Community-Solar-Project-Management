# Decentralized Community Solar Project Management System

A blockchain-based platform that democratizes access to renewable energy through fractional ownership of solar installations, transparent production tracking, equitable credit distribution, and collective maintenance management.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to create a trustless ecosystem for community solar projects, enabling individuals to invest in, benefit from, and maintain shared solar installations without requiring centralized intermediaries. By creating immutable records of ownership, production, credits, and maintenance, the platform increases accessibility to renewable energy while ensuring fair distribution of benefits and responsibilities.
